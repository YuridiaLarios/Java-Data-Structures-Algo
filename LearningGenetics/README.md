Java class using generics: Trio.

Objects of this class hold three unordered items of the same type. 

A Trio object is unordered.
For example, the Trio (3, 4, 5) is considered the same as the Trio (4, 5, 3) and the Trio ("hi", "bye", "hello") 
is considered the same as the Trio ("hello", "hi", "bye").
The order doesn't matter. (This is like a set in mathematics.)

A Trio can hold three Integers or it could hold three Strings or it could hold three Students, etc.
A Trio could not, however, hold two Integers and a String.
